# Multiple Value Visualization

## ðŸš€ Quick start for Viz Customization

1.  **Install Dependecies.**

    Using yarn, install all dependencies
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```
4.  **Compile your code**

    You need to compile your react code, let's run:
    ```sh

    yarn build
    ```
    Your compiled code can be found at `./dist`

**`multiple_value.js`**: This visualization's minified distribution file. 

**`.babelrc`**: A configuration file for the Babel jsx -> js compiler.

**`manifest.lkml`**: Looker's external dependencies configuration file. The visualization object is defined here.

**`marketplace.json`**: A JSON file containing information the marketplace installer uses to set up this project.

**`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

**`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the visualization's source code.

**`LICENSE`**: Looker's Marketplace content License file.

**`README.md`**: This! A text file containing useful reference information about this visualization.

**`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
